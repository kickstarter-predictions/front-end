# Kickstarter Campaign Predictions 

## 👋 About Our App:

Kickstarter business dataset collected from [kickstarter.com](https://www.kickstarter.com/) is being utilized to generate predictions of whether or not a business will succeed based on factors such as amount of money pledged, what the business' goal is/was, the country they occured in and many more.

## ☝️ Our Proposal:

Is it possible to make relatively accurate predictions on whether or not a kickstarter campaign will fail or succeed?
